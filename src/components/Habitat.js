      Officially; there are about 100 ligers in the world.
      This population of the ligers is based upon scientifically collected data from
      different worldwide zoos, animal sanctuaries, safari and wild animal parks,
      wildlife centers and menageries. Ligerzoos.com which is an online website
      that tracks liger zoos from all around the world, has tracked more than 40 zoos,
      all over the world that had ligers. According to LIGER ZOOS website,
      majority of zoos which had ligers are located in United States,
      China and Russia. Recently; National Geographic has also pointed out total
      numbers of liger around the world to almost 100. However; there is a big
      possibility that the total numbers of ligers in the world will be more than 100,
      if we include privately owned liger pets as well in the overall total count.
