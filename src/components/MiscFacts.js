    One of thee first fusor zoids was the liger zero phoenix:
    Initially the Fire Phoenix was a wild Zoid, but was eventually turned into a
    reliable Fuzor partner to the Liger Zero. It never used its guns or its missiles,
    and was shown to sport an Energy Shield. The Liger Zero Phoenix was remarkably powerful,
    easily overwhelming even other Fuzor Zoids with its Diving Laser Claw attack.
    It was also incredibly durable, and was able to withstand a direct hit from a Charged Particle Cannon.
    However, the Fuzor was no longer because the Fire Phoenix was sacrificed when it performed a suicidal
    attack on Blake's Gairyuki.
