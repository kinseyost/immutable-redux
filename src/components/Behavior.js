          Protection:
        </h1>
        Ligers are bad-ass.  They can kill anything, even a honey badger.  They protect themselves.

          Sleeping Habits:
        </h1>
        Ligers are nocuturnal and spend most of the day sleeping.  Sometimes in a zoo setting this behavior is disrupted.
